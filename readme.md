## Architecture

The Arbitrum dApp Dashboard consists of a front-end React application and a back-end Express.js server.

### Front-end

The front-end is built with React and uses react-router-dom for routing. Key components include:

- Dashboard: The main landing page
- SingleFileDeploy: Interface for deploying individual smart contracts
- Templates: Browse and use pre-built contract templates
- Resources: Access documentation, tutorials, community, and tools
- Chat: AI-powered support chat interface

### Back-end

The back-end is an Express.js server that handles:

- Contract compilation and deployment
- File uploads (using Multer)
- Input validation
- Chat functionality

## Installation

To set up the Arbitrum dApp Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arbitrum-dapp-dashboard.git
   cd arbitrum-dapp-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both front-end and back-end:

   ```bash
   # Install front-end dependencies
   cd front-end
   npm install

   # Install back-end dependencies
   cd ../back-end
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=6190
   ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```

## Usage

To run the application locally:

1. Start the back-end server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the front-end development server:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Arbitrum dApp Dashboard.

## Deployment

The Arbitrum dApp Dashboard can be deployed to various cloud platforms. Here's a general outline for deployment:

1. Build the front-end:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the back-end to a Node.js hosting service (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS):

   - Set up the necessary environment variables on your hosting platform
   - Deploy the contents of the `server` directory

3. Deploy the front-end build to a static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3):

   - Deploy the contents of the `client/build` directory

4. Configure your front-end deployment to point to your back-end API URL
